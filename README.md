# ODE-Solver-Parallel-2    
- This repository contains code that solves ODE with many boundary conditions that are auto generated based on boundary conditions entered by the user.  
- Solving ODE with auto generated boundary conditions may not be much useful. However, here this has been done for showing how MPI can be used more than once by calling it only once. Since MPI can only be called once in a main function, here author shows a simple way achieve iterative use of MPI. 
- MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver (MUMPS) has been used as a solver for linear systems.  
- Message Passing interface (MPI) has been used only while solving linear systems that have been generated iteratively. Other parts of code are without MPI (serial).  
- ***Only Solver part (linear system solver) is in parallel and rest of the code runs in a serial fashion including matrix and right hand side(rhs) generation.***  
- Main source code for this software includes `.c , .cpp and .hpp` files only. Rest all files will be generated by the code itself including `.txt` files.  
- While running code locally, user can delete those txt files. Code will run perfectly and generate those files in the workspace folder.
