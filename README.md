# ODE-Solver-Parallel-2
-This repository contains code that solves ODE with many boundary conditions that are auto generated based on boundary conditions entered by the user.  
-MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver (MUMPS) has been used a solver for linear systems.  
-Message Passing interface (MPI) has been used only while solving linear system each time. Other parts of code are without MPI.  
-***Only Solver part is in parallel and rest of the code runs in a serial fashion including matrix and right hand side(rhs) generation.***  
-.txt files are being generated by the code itself.  
-While running code locally, user can delete those txt files. Code will run perfectly and generate those files in the workspace folder.
