# ODE-Solver-Parallel-2
This repository contains code that solves ODE with many boundary conditions that are auto generated based on boundary conditions entered by the user. MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver (MUMPS) has been used a solver for linear systems. Message Passing interface (MPI) has been used while solving linear system each time.
